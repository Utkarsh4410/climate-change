<p>How do we know that changes in the Sun aren’t to blame 
for current global warming trends?

<p>Since 1978, a series of satellite instruments have 
measured the energy output of the Sun directly. 
The satellite data show a very slight drop in solar 
irradiance (which is a measure of the amount of energy 
the Sun gives off) over this time period. So the Sun 
doesn't appear to be responsible for the warming trend 
observed over the past several decades.

<p>Longer-term estimates of solar irradiance have been 
made using sunspot records and other so-called “proxy 
indicators,” such as the amount of carbon in tree rings. 
The most recent analyses of these proxies indicate that 
solar irradiance changes cannot plausibly account for more 
than 10 percent of the 20th century’s warming.

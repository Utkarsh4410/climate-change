<h6>We Live in a Greenhouse</h6>
</font>
Life on Earth depends on energy coming 
from the Sun. About half the light 
reaching Earth's atmosphere passes 
through the air and clouds to the 
surface, where it is absorbed and 
then radiated upward in the form of 
infrared heat. About 90 percent of 
this heat is then absorbed by the 
greenhouse gases and radiated back 
toward the surface.
